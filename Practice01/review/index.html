There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small...</small>
<mark>the</mark> <del>list</del> <ins>goes</ins> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.</p>
<p>
You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:<br>
<blockquote>
    Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
    time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
    we seek.

<div>A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
and take up the full width available.</div><br>
<span>And a span tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.</span><br><br>
