    <h1>This is a Heading (h1)</h1>
    <h2>This is a Heading too! (h2)</h2>
    <h3>This is also a Heading! (h3)</h3>
    <h4>This just goes on...</h4>
    <h5>and on..</h5>
    <h6>till h6!</h6>

    <p>This is a paragraph (p). Line breaks here: <br>and continues...</p>

    <p>There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small...</small> <mark>the</mark> <s>list</s> <u>goes</u> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.</p>

    <p>You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
        <blockquote>
            Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.
        </blockquote>

        <li>Ordered Lists!</li>
        <li>As you can see it is marked with numbers.</li>

    <h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
    <div>
        <p>A < div > is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line and take up the full width available. </p>
    </div>
    <span>
        <p>And a < span > tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
    </span>
